Patternfly Core is based on the principles of Atomic design (http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) (http://getbem.com/introduction/).

Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems, where page designs are broken down into reusable components that can be assembled to create reusable interaction patterns that can be assembled to create page designs.

PatternFly consists of isolated and modular structures that fall into 2 categories:
* Layouts - the containers that allow for organizing and grouping its immediate children on the page
* Components - modular and independent structures concerned with presentation

PatternFly also provides presentational Demos. Demos illustrate how to assemble complex structures with components and layouts. Unlike components and layouts, Demos do not include their own styles.
