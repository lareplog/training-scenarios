In patternfly, components can be like atoms, molecules, or organisms. As described by Brad Frost in Atomic Design, “Atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.”

## Workshop: Add a button component

a. The button is an example of an atom, as it cannot be broken down into further parts. Its modular in the fact that it can be repeated over and over again by reusing the code.

b. Add this code for the button into the editor. 

<pre class="file" data-filename="index.html" data-target="replace">
&lt;button class=&quot;pf-c-button pf-m-primary&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  Primary
&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>

c. Add code for another button into the editor:

`<button class="pf-c-button pf-m-primary" type="button">
  Primary
</button>`

d. You can start to see that these are modular atoms being added to the workspace!
